# SC1015-Mini-Project
- This is a data analysis project that aims to investigate the data science behind anime scores and the variables that may affect them. The project involves analyzing a dataset of anime shows, which includes information such as title, genre, episode count, release year, source material, licensors, producers, and user scores.
- The project is implemented in Python using the popular data analysis libraries Pandas and Matplotlib. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, data types, and inconsistencies. Various data analysis techniques are applied to gain insights into the relationship between anime scores and different variables, such as themes and genres, demographics, release year, etc.

# Our Problem Statement
We want to predict viewers' liking of a new anime based on various factors such as producing company, genres, age ratings and number of episodes, etc.

# Our Motivation
- With the wide variety of anime available, it may overwhelm viewers when choosing what show to watch. As such, our analysis helps to predict and improve viewer satisfaction.
- In addition, an average 13-episode anime can cost up to US$2 million to produce. Stakeholders in the anime industry may be motivated to have a data-driven approach to decision-making when it comes to the various factors which may affect viewership and market anime to specific audiences hence enhance viewership ratings and maximise profit, reducing risk of financial losses.

# Main objectives
Understand the distribution of anime scores and identify any trends or patterns
Explore the relationship between anime scores and different variables
Visualize the findings using bar charts and other graphical representations

#### The project is organized in the following manner:

**Data Cleaning**: This section includes the cleaning and preprocessing of the raw dataset, handling missing values, data types, and inconsistencies.

**Data Analysis**: This section includes the data analysis techniques applied to gain insights into the relationship between anime scores and different variables, such as genre, episode count, release year, and licensors. This includes the results of the data analysis and the visualizations created to present the findings in an easy-to-understand manner.

**Machine Learning**: This section includes machine learning models we have used on our dataset, Multivariate Regression and Random Forest Classifier


# Our Analysis
We analyse the
1. `Type` of anime
2. `Source` of anime
3. `Themes_Genres` of anime
4. `Studios` of anime
5. `Demographics` of anime
6. `Producers` of anime
7. `Licensors` of anime
8. `Rating` of anime

and how they may affect the `Score` of anime in `Exploratory Data Analysis`.
